

"Could it be that my dream is continuing?" Raskolnikov thought again, as he regarded the unexpected visitor with an attentive and wary air. "Svidrigaïlov! What nonsense!"  
"Impossible," he finally said aloud in his astonishment   

The stranger did not seem surprised by this exclamation.  
"I have come to see you for two reasons: First, I wished to make your acquaintance, as I have heard much about you—spoken of in the most flattering terms. Secondly, I hope you might not refuse me your assistance with a matter concerning your sister, Avdotia Romanovna. Alone and without a recommendation, I would likely be turned away by her, now that she has been warned against me. But with your help, well, I am counting on the opposite..."  

"You’re wrong," Raskolnikov interrupted him.  
"Those ladies arrived just yesterday, did they not? May I ask you that?"  

Raskolnikov did not reply.  
"Yesterday, yes, I know. I myself have only been here since the day before. Well then, here is what I wish to say about this, Rodion Romanovitch. I see no need to justify myself, but allow me to ask you: is there anything particularly criminal on my part in all this, if, of course, one considers the matter rationally and without prejudice? You will say, no doubt, that I pursued a defenseless young girl in my own house and insulted her with disgraceful propositions (you see, I am anticipating the accusation myself), but consider only that I am a man, *nihil humanum*... in short, that I am susceptible to passion, to falling in love (a thing that is beyond one’s control), and then everything is explained in the most natural way. That’s the crux of the matter: am I a monster or a victim? Let’s suppose I’m a victim, for, after all, when I proposed to the object of my affection to flee with me to America or Switzerland, perhaps I harbored the most respectful feelings toward her and was only thinking of securing our mutual happiness. Reason is the slave of passion. It is myself, above all, that I was risking harming..."  

"This is not about that," Raskolnikov replied with disgust. "Whether you are wrong or right, you are simply odious, and we want nothing to do with you. I’m dismissing you—go."  

Svidrigaïlov burst into sudden laughter.  
"Ah yes! One might say that you... you don’t let yourself be tricked," he said with open cheerfulness. "I thought I could outwit you, but with you, it doesn’t work."  
"And yet, you’re still trying to trick me!"  
"Well, so what? So what?" Svidrigaïlov repeated, laughing heartily. "It’s fair play, as they say, and the most innocent ruse, but you didn’t let me finish: all the same, I continue to claim that nothing unpleasant would have happened without that incident in the garden. Marfa Petrovna..."  
"They also say you killed Marfa Petrovna," Raskolnikov interrupted bluntly.  

"Ah, so you’ve heard about that too! Not surprising... Well, as for the question you ask me, I really don’t know what to tell you, although my conscience is perfectly clear in that regard. Don’t think that I have anything to fear from the consequences of that matter. All the necessary formalities were carried out in the most proper and meticulous way: the medical investigation concluded it was a stroke caused by taking a bath after a sumptuous meal, during which the deceased drank nearly a bottle of wine. They couldn’t discover anything else... No, that’s not what concerns me. Here’s what I was thinking about on the way here, and especially while traveling by train: had I, I wondered, morally contributed to this misfortune... by my irritation or something similar? But I concluded it could not have been so."  

Raskolnikov laughed.  
"What are you worrying about?"  
"Why are you laughing? Think about it: I only gave her two light strokes with a whip, which didn’t even leave marks... Don’t judge me cynical, I beg you. I know perfectly well that it was vile of me, yes, etc. But I also know that Marfa Petrovna was quite pleased with this... let’s call it my outburst. The affair with your sister had worn itself out, and Marfa Petrovna, having nothing left to gossip about in town, had for three days been forced to stay home; besides, she had already bored everyone with reading her letter aloud (have you heard about it?). And then suddenly, those two providential strokes with the whip! Her first action was to have the carriage harnessed! ...Not to mention the cases where women take great pleasure in being offended, despite all the indignation they display (such cases exist). Man, in general, likes to be humiliated—have you noticed? But this trait is particularly frequent among women; one might even say it’s the essence of their lives."  

At one point, Raskolnikov considered getting up and leaving to cut the conversation short, but a certain curiosity, and even a kind of calculation, led him to wait.  

"Do you like using the whip?" he asked distractedly.  
"Not particularly," Svidrigaïlov replied calmly. "As for Marfa Petrovna, I almost never quarreled with her. We lived in very good harmony, and she was pleased with me. I only used the whip twice during our seven years of marriage (if we don’t count one rather ambiguous third instance). The first time was two months after our wedding, when we arrived at the estate, and the second and last time was in the circumstances I mentioned. And you, you think of me as a monster, don’t you? A backward man, a supporter of serfdom, ha, ha!... By the way, don’t you recall, Rodion Romanovitch, that some years ago, during the blessed municipal assemblies, a landowner—I can’t recall his name—was disgraced for whipping a foreign woman on a train? Do you remember? It was the same year, I believe, as that 'horrible incident of the Century.' Come on, *Egyptian Nights,* the lectures, you remember? Black eyes! Oh, wonderful times of our youth, where have you gone?..."  


"On his horse, saber in hand: Allah commands it; submit, trembling and miserable creature! He is right, he is right, the Prophet, who positions a fine troop across the street with cannons, then strikes both the righteous and the guilty without bothering to explain. Submit then, miserable and trembling creature, and dare not to assert your will. It is not your place... Oh, never, never will I forgive the old woman."

His hair was drenched in sweat, his dry lips trembled, and his fixed gaze did not leave the ceiling.
"My mother, my sister—how much I loved them! Why do I now hate them? Yes, I hate them, with a physical hatred. I cannot bear their presence near me... Earlier, I went to my mother and embraced her, I remember it... Holding her in my arms and thinking that if she knew... Should I confess to her, perhaps? I would feel relieved of this burden... Hmm! She must be like me," he added with effort, as though struggling against the encroaching delirium. "Oh, how I hate the old woman now! I think I would kill her again if she were to resurrect. Poor Lisbeth! Why was it her ill luck to be there?... It’s strange, though, that I think so little about her, as if I hadn’t killed her. Lisbeth! Sonia! Poor, gentle creatures with soft eyes! Dear ones... Why don’t they cry? Why don’t they wail? They give everything they have... with their resigned and tender gazes... Sonia, sweet Sonia!"

He lost consciousness of himself and was greatly surprised to find he could not recall how he ended up outside. The evening was already well advanced. Darkness thickened, and the full moon shone brighter and brighter, yet the air seemed particularly stifling. The streets were crowded with people; there was a smell of lime, dust, and stagnant water. He walked on, sad and preoccupied. He clearly remembered leaving his home with a specific purpose in mind. He knew there was something urgent he needed to do, but what it was, he couldn’t recall. Suddenly, he stopped and noticed a man across the street signaling to him.

He crossed the street to meet him, but the man abruptly turned around and walked off, head down, without looking back or seeming to have called him.
"Did he really call me?" Raskolnikov wondered. Still, he followed him. After about ten steps, he suddenly recognized the man and was seized with fear.

It was the same man as earlier, dressed in the same loose garment, stooped as before. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance, his heart pounding. They entered a narrow alley, the man never turning back. "Does he know I’m following him?" Raskolnikov thought. The man went through the gateway of a large building. Raskolnikov quickly approached and looked inside; he expected the man to turn and call him. Indeed, when the stranger reached the courtyard, he seemed to gesture toward him again. Raskolnikov hurried through the gateway but, upon entering the courtyard, found no one.

The man must have taken the first staircase. Raskolnikov hurried in after him. Sure enough, on the second floor, he heard the sound of slow, steady footsteps.

Strangely, the staircase seemed familiar to him. Here was the window on the first landing, where a mysterious and melancholy moonbeam shone through the glass. And here was the second landing. "Ah, but this is the apartment where the painters worked!"

How had he not recognized the building sooner? The footsteps ahead of him ceased. "He must have stopped, hiding somewhere? And here’s the third floor. Should I continue or not? What silence!"

The sound of his own footsteps frightened him. "Lord, what darkness! The stranger must be hiding in some corner, around here. Wait, the apartment door is wide open to the landing!"

He paused for a moment, then entered. The vestibule was very dark and empty, as though everything had been removed. Quietly, on tiptoe, he moved into the sitting room. The entire room was violently lit by the moon. Nothing seemed changed: the chairs, the mirror, the yellow sofa, and the paintings in their frames were all still there. Through the window, he could see the enormous, round moon, glowing a coppery red. "It’s the moon creating the silence," thought Raskolnikov. "She’s busy deciphering riddles..."

He stood there, immobile, waiting. As the nocturnal stillness grew, the pounding of his heart became louder, more painful, and the silence continued... Suddenly, there was a sharp crack, like wood breaking, then silence again. A fly awoke and flew against the windowpane; its plaintive buzzing could be heard.

At that moment, he thought he saw something in the corner between the small cabinet and the window: a coat hanging on the wall. "What’s a coat doing here?" he wondered. "It wasn’t there before..."

He cautiously moved it aside with his hand and saw a chair, and on that chair, in the corner, an old woman, hunched over, her head bowed so low he couldn’t see her face—but it was her.

He stood still at her feet. "She’s afraid," he thought, as he slowly loosened his axe from the loop, then struck her once, then a second time, on the back of the neck. But, strangely, she didn’t even flinch under the blows—she seemed made of wood. Terrified, he leaned in closer to examine her, but she only bowed her head further. Then he bent all the way to the floor to look up at her. What he saw horrified him. The old woman was laughing; she was shaking with a silent laugh that she seemed to be stifling as best she could.

Suddenly, it seemed to him that the door to the bedroom had slightly opened and that there was laughter coming from there, too. He heard a whisper... Rage took hold of him... He began striking the old woman on the head with all his strength, but with every blow of the axe, the laughter and whispers grew louder in the next room, and the old woman herself was convulsed with her silent, spasmodic laughter.

He wanted to run away, but the vestibule was full of people, the door to the stairs wide open, and everywhere—on the landing, on the steps, everywhere—there were people, heads upon heads, all watching, trying to hide themselves. They were waiting in silence... His heart clenched; his legs refused to obey him, they seemed nailed to the floor... He wanted to cry out but woke up.

He breathed heavily, but, strangely, the dream seemed to continue: his door was wide open, and a man, entirely unknown to him, stood in the doorway, watching him intently.

Raskolnikov, who had only half-opened his eyes, hastily closed them again. He lay on his back, motionless. "Is the dream continuing or not?" he wondered and lifted his eyelids almost imperceptibly to look: the stranger, still in the same place, was watching him just as attentively. Suddenly, he stepped softly over the threshold, carefully closed the door behind him, approached the table, waited a moment without taking his eyes off him, then quietly sat on a chair near the sofa.

He placed his hat on the floor, rested both hands on the head of his cane, then leaned his chin on it. It was clear he was prepared for a long wait. As far as Raskolnikov could tell from a furtive glance, the man was no longer young; he looked robust and had a thick blond beard already graying...

Ten minutes passed like this. It was still light, but the day was fading. The deepest silence reigned in the room. Not even a sound came from the staircase. Only a large fly, having flown into the windowpane, buzzed and struggled. Finally, it became unbearable. Raskolnikov rose and sat up on the sofa.

"Well," he said, "what do you want?"
"I knew you weren’t asleep, that you were only pretending," the stranger replied with a calm smile. "Allow me to introduce myself: Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigaïlov."
